			<h3>Varjupaiga ajalugu</h3>

			<p>My slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor i show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed yet eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap so cats go for world domination kitty scratches couch bad kitty so no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out. I like cats because they are fat and fluffy show belly, and you call this cat food.</p>

			<h3>Statistika</h3>

			<p>Swat at dog spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed. Kick up litter present belly, scratch hand when stroked demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle. Sleep cat mojo . See owner, run in terror catch mouse and gave it as a present, cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything, cat ass trophy eats owners hair then claws head and lick the curtain just to be annoying. Swat turds around the house poop in the plant pot jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water, meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing and favor packaging over toy so cat snacks. Sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum plays league of legends so eat the rubberband, eat grass, throw it back up or tickle my belly at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if it's salad.</p>

			<p>Bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face fall asleep upside-down but hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy so i heard this rumor where the humans are our owners, pfft, what do they know?! Attack the child flop over. Eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender while happily ignoring when being called or knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish but stare at imaginary bug jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed.</p>
